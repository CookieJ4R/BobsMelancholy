# Bobs Melancholy
BobÂ´s Melancholy is a fun and ~~unfair~~ difficult platformer written in Unity.

It consists of 5 levels. A controller, while not required, improves the game experience dramatically.

The game itself may be released on itch.io in the future. For now the game can only be played by building the game itself through unity.
